We'll be developing some NLP tools from scratch in Python and C++ while we take a Natural Language Processing course. Nothing too fancy, just for fun.

* Tokenization: we are implementing a tokenization space-based libary capable of tokenizing special characters found in spanish (e.g. 'รก').
* Stop word removal.
* TF-IDF calculation.
* One-Hot encoding.
